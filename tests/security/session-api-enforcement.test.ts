/**
 * Sessions must get real enforcement, not just the parent API.
 *
 * Real MCP clients never touch the API the server constructs directly — they get
 * a per-session SecureObsidianAPI built inside
 * MCPServerPool.createPooledServer, captured in a closure with no registry
 * exposing it. Two assumptions hold read-only together for those clients, and
 * neither was covered by a test:
 *
 *   1. the pool passes the live plugin reference, so the read-only predicate has
 *      a setting to read (without it, read-only silently does not apply)
 *   2. the pool never builds an unsecured session API
 *
 * Both previously rested on reading the code. If someone changed the pool to
 * pass a derived settings object, or omitted the plugin, the other liveness
 * tests would still pass while production regressed to the original bug.
