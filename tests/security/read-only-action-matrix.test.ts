/**
 * Exhaustive read-only enforcement matrix.
 *
 * Derives the action list from getActionsForOperation() — the same source the
 * shipped tool schemas are built from — rather than a hand-written list, so a
 * newly added action appears here automatically and FAILS until it is
 * explicitly classified as read or write. That fail-closed property is the
 * point: the 0.11.42 bypasses existed because `edit` and `bases.create` were
 * never classified as writes anywhere.
 *
 * Each write action is checked three times:
 *   - read-only (live predicate)  -> must record ZERO vault writes
 *   - security layer (preset)     -> ZERO writes, AND the refusal must name the
 *                                   gate (PERMISSION_DENIED / READ_ONLY_MODE)
 *   - permissive                  -> AT LEAST ONE write (positive control)
 *
 * The positive control and the named-refusal check are what stop vacuous passes.
 * Without them, an action that throws on missing params — or one whose error is
 * swallowed and re-reported as something unrelated, as vault.copy's was — records
 * no writes and looks "correctly blocked" while testing nothing at all.

 *  - 'securityLayer' readOnlyMode false + presets.readOnly() -> the SNAPSHOT
 *                    denies, with the predicate inactive. Keeps the preset path
 *                    covered so ADR-108's predicate isn't the only thing holding
 *                    the boundary. Historically this mode existed because the
 *                    legacy tool-layer guard satisfied the vault.* assertions and
 *                    hid a bypass; that guard is gone, but the mode still pins
 *                    the preset path.
